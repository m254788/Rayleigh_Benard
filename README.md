# Rayleigh Benard Flow Simulation
Rayleigh Benard convection is created when a fluid is heated by a hot plate from below and cooled from a cold plate from above. The hot liquid rises as the cold liquid falls, creating beautiful vortices.

Serial lattice boltzmann implementations in Python (Jupyter Notebooks) and C++, GPU accelerated version in CUDA. Based on Prof. Jonas Latt's Matlab implementation and CAPT Stu Blair's LBM code.
